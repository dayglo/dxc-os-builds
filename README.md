DXC OS builds
====================

This project stores the repacker sources that build our vm images and deploy them to the dev vmware.

To use this project, you will need to install:-

1. [packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html);
1. [repacker](https://github.com/dayglo/repacker);
1. [vsphere packer builder](https://github.com/dayglo/packer-builder-vsphere);
1. vmware [workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/workstation-evaluation.html) or [fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html) (dxc users can get this from the IT tool); 
1. [ovftool](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/); 
1. [git](https://git-scm.com/);

To deploy the templates to our infrastructure you'll need to be able to access the vmware platform. Speak to me about how to get on there.
